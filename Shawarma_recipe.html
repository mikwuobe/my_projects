            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe brings a taste of Shawarma Paradise to your home kitchen. It captures the essence of <br> our signature shawarma with readily available ingredients and a simplified cooking method.</p>
            <h2>How to Prepare</h2>
            <p>Step 1: Marinate the meat: In a large bowl, combine yogurt, lemon juice, olive oil, spices (cumin,<br> coriander, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cinnamon), salt, and pepper. Add chicken <br> breasts (or lamb, beef) and toss to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, <br> or up to overnight for deeper flavor. <br>
               Step 2: Cook the meat: Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Arrange chicken pieces on a baking sheet<br> and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through and juices run clear. Alternatively, grill the <br> chicken for a smoky flavor. <br>
               Step 3: Prepare the vegetables: While the meat cooks, chop tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, and parsley.<br>
               Step 4: Make the sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, yogurt, tahini (if <br> using), lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper. Adjust seasonings to taste. <br>
               Step 5: Assemble the shawarma: Warm pita breads in the oven or microwave. Slice the cooked <br> chicken into thin strips. Spread desired amount of sauce inside each pita bread. Fill with <br> chicken strips, tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, and parsley. Sprinkle with dried oregano for <br> added flavor. <br>
               Step 6: Enjoy! Roll up the pita bread and savor the delicious taste of Pinch of Heaven Shawarma at home.</p>
